## NE24 Project

The final project for this course consist of several items:

*  an [abstract](#abstract) with a proposal for your project, due March
 20, 2017;
*  the [project](#project) itself, due April 28, 2017; and
*  a [presentation](#presentation) about the project, given in class on April
  24, 2017.

### Project
Due 2017/04/28 

The final project for this class is to submit a pull request (or equivalent) to an open source coding project.
The project should be in some way related to computational science.
The project can be in any language that you want.
It can be hosted on GitHub or BitBucket (which is easy), or anywhere that you can contribute and provide documentation about your contribution. 
The pull request needs to tangibly contribute to the project in some way. 
This can be any of:

* adding new functionality,
* adding or improving testing,
* adding or improving documentation,
* adding or improving examples, or
* something else you feel the project would benefit from.

This should allow you to tailor the project to your personal level of skill, while still pushing yourself to grow.

You may work with a *partner* or in a *group* of up to three people. 
If you choose this route, know that the scope of the project must appropriately increase compared to doing a project by yourself.

Places to look for projects:

* Open source projects organized by technical area that use SciPy: [here](http://www.scipy.org/topical-software.html#topic-guides-organized-by-scientific-field)
* PyNE, Python for Nuclear Engineering: [GitHub page](https://github.com/pyne/pyne) and [website](http://pyne.io/)
* If you find another useful list, add it here and submit a pull request to this project page :).

Note that most codes will have a list of Issues or Tickets that detail code needs.
Many of these are labeled as "novice" or "low-hanging fruit", etc.
You can also often contact someone from the development team to see if they have suggestions for good ways to get involved.

-----------
### Abstract
Due 2017/03/20 

Submit an abstract on bCourses or via email that is one page or less (unless you are in a group, in which case it can be longer) discussing what you will do for your project. This should include:

1. The project to which you would like to contribute.
2. An outline of what you intend to do. 
Include specifically the objective you are trying to accomplish and why that will help the project.
3. Major steps required to execute the project.
4. Deadlines associated with each of these steps.
5. What you need to do to accomplish each step (laying out a path to success).
6. If you are working with a partner or in a group, specify how the work will be divided and who will do what.

-----------
### Presentation
Due 2017/04/24

We will do in-class presentations on the last day of class. 
The presentation length will depend upon how many groups we get, but for now plan on five minutes. 
The talk should include:

* What project you selected and what it is.
* What you did.
* Anything awesome you learned in the process.
